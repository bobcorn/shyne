IOT system concept in which network-capable lights are controlled by a centralized brain that makes sure that offices are properly illuminated. The system is able to react to the presence of people in a room, external light conditions and time. Project work for course "Innovation and Project Management" during my Master's degree at University of Bologna, carried out with my colleagues Marco Boschi, Matteo Galletti, Nicola Severini, Matteo Grilli, Francesco Frassineti, Kevin Leto and Franco Bogliolo. The project has been developed for the business context of VEM Sistemi S.p.A.
